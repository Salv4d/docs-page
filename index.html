        <p>
          If you do much work on computers, eventually you find that there’s
          some task you’d like to automate. For example, you may wish to perform
          a search-and-replace over a large number of text files, or rename and
          rearrange a bunch of photo files in a complicated way. Perhaps you’d
          like to write a small custom database, or a specialized GUI
          application, or a simple game.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you’re a professional software developer, you may have to work with
          several C/C++/Java libraries but find the usual
          write/compile/test/re-compile cycle is too slow. Perhaps you’re
          writing a test suite for such a library and find writing the testing
          code a tedious task. Or maybe you’ve written a program that could use
          an extension language, and you don’t want to design and implement a
          whole new language for your application.
        </p>
        <p>Python is just the language for you.</p>
        <p>
          You could write a Unix shell script or Windows batch files for some of
          these tasks, but shell scripts are best at moving around files and
          changing text data, not well-suited for GUI applications or games. You
          could write a C/C++/Java program, but it can take a lot of development
          time to get even a first-draft program. Python is simpler to use,
          available on Windows, macOS, and Unix operating systems, and will help
          you get the job done more quickly.

      <section class="main-section" id="Using_the_Python_Interpreter">
        <header><h2>Using the Python Interpreter</h2></header>
        <p>
          The Python interpreter is usually installed as
          <code>/usr/local/bin/python3.10</code> on those machines where it is
          available; putting <code>/usr/local/bin</code> in your Unix shell’s search path
          makes it possible to start it by typing the command to the shell:
          <pre><code>python3.10</code></pre>
        </p>
        <p>
            Since the choice of the directory where the interpreter lives is an installation option, other places are possible; check with your local Python guru or system administrator. (E.g., <code>/usr/local/python</code> is a popular alternative location.)
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="An_Informal_Introduction_to_Python">
          <header><h2>An Informal Introduction to Python</h2></header>
          <p>In the following examples, input and output are distinguished by the presence or absence of prompts (>>> and …): to repeat the example, you must type everything after the prompt, when the prompt appears; lines that do not begin with a prompt are output from the interpreter. Note that a secondary prompt on a line by itself in an example means you must type a blank line; this is used to end a multi-line command.</p>
          <h3>3.1. Using Python as a Calculator</h3>
          <p>The interpreter acts as a simple calculator: you can type an expression at it and it will write the value. Expression syntax is straightforward: the operators <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code> and <code>/</code> work just like in most other languages (for example, Pascal or C); parentheses (<code>()</code>) can be used for grouping. For example:
          <pre>
            <code>
>>> 2 + 2
4
>>> 50 - 5*6
20
>>> (50 - 5*6) / 4
5.0
>>> 8 / 5  # division always returns a floating point number
1.6
            </code>
          </pre>
        </p>
        <h3>First Steps Towards Programming</h3>
        <p>
          Of course, we can use Python for more complicated tasks than adding two and two together. For instance, we can write an initial sub-sequence of the Fibonacci series as follows:
          <pre>
            <code>
>>> # Fibonacci series:
... # the sum of two elements defines the next
... a, b = 0, 1
>>> while a < 10:
...     print(a)
...     a, b = b, a+b
...
0
1
1
2
3
5
8 
            </code>
          </pre>
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="More_Control_Flow_Tools">
        <header><h2>More Control Flow Tools</h2></header>
        <p>Besides the while statement just introduced, Python uses the usual flow control statements known from other languages, with some twists.</p>
        <h3>if Statements</h3>
        <p>
          Perhaps the most well-known statement type is the if statement. For example:
          <pre>
            <code>
>>> x = int(input("Please enter an integer: "))
Please enter an integer: 42
>>> if x < 0:
...     x = 0
...     print('Negative changed to zero')
... elif x == 0:
...     print('Zero')
... elif x == 1:
...     print('Single')
... else:
...     print('More')
...
More
            </code>
          </pre>
        </p>
        <h3>for Statement</h3>
        <p>The for statement in Python differs a bit from what you may be used to in C or Pascal. Rather than always iterating over an arithmetic progression of numbers (like in Pascal), or giving the user the ability to define both the iteration step and halting condition (as C), Python’s for statement iterates over the items of any sequence (a list or a string), in the order that they appear in the sequence. For example (no pun intended):
          <pre>
            <code>
>>> # Measure some strings:
... words = ['cat', 'window', 'defenestrate']
>>> for w in words:
...     print(w, len(w))
...
cat 3
window 6
defenestrate 12
            </code>
          </pre>
        </p>

                You should browse through this manual, which gives complete (though terse) reference material about types, functions, and the modules in the standard library. The standard Python distribution includes a lot of additional code. There are modules to read Unix mailboxes, retrieve documents via HTTP, generate random numbers, parse command-line options, write CGI programs, compress data, and many other tasks. Skimming through the Library Reference will give you an idea of what’s available.
